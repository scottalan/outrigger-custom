This image provides the many development tools necessary to build applications
the Outrigger way, bundled with a wide array of tools useful for development and
troubleshooting via the command-line interface. While it is possible to directly
connect via our "web" containers, this is the preferred way to perform "server work".

Contains everything you need to work with Drupal, including use of tools such as
[Grunt-Drupal-Tasks](https://github.com/phase2/grunt-drupal-tasks) and
[Pattern Lab Starter](https://github.com/phase2/pattern-lab-starter/).

For more documentation on how Outrigger images are constructed and how to work
with them, please [see the documentation](http://docs.outrigger.sh/en/latest/).

## Features

* Out of the box support for PHP (version based on tag), Ruby 1.9.3 and Node versions
4.x (LTS), 5.x (stable) and 6.x (LTS) based on environment toggle (see below).
* Global availability of Composer, Drush, Drupal Console, NPM, Bower, Grunt, Gulp, and Yeoman.

For more details of specific packages, libraries, and utilities, please see the
[Dockerfile](https://github.com/phase2/docker-build/blob/php70/Dockerfile).

### Drush (Drupal Shell) Integration

There is global configuration for Drush at `/etc/drush/drushrc.php`.

Default configuration in this file provides the following:

* Unlimited memory for PHP operations run via Drush.
* Unlimited execution time for PHP operations run via Drush.
* Drush commands will be looked up in `/etc/drush/commands`.
* Drush aliases will be looked up in `/etc/drush`.

### Additional Commands

* **Registry Rebuild**: `drush rr` is included by default.

### BASH History Persistence

If you would like your bash history preserved, provide a volume mount to a persistent
data location at /root/bash and initialization scripts will ensure your .bash\_history
file is written there. For example `/data/PROJECT/bash:/root/bash`

## Environment Variables

Outrigger images use Environment Variables and [confd](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd)
to templatize a number of Docker environment configurations. These templates are
processed on startup with environment variables passed in via the docker run
command-line or via your docker-compose manifest file. Here are the "tunable"
configurations offered by this image.

* `NODE_VERSION`: [`4`|`5`|`6`] Defaults to 4. Selects the major version of Node
  to make available to all tools via nvm. The latest minor release as of the image build will be used.
* `PHP_XDEBUG`: [`"true"`|`"false"`] Specify whether the PHP Xdebug extension should be enabled.
